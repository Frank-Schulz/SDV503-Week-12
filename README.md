## Hash Tables
Hash tables are similar to objects in that both use key value pairs.
However, their usage is more akin to that of an array; a much faster 
array.
The great thing about Hash Tables is that they are fast, 
generally O(1), because the look up has direct access. It's the 
implementation of the hash function that really affects the speed of 
your Hash Table.
Conversely the use of a Hash Table is really only worth it when you 
have many items to use it with. If you only have a couple of values 
then a normal array is more effective.
